# Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

# Only one letter can be changed at a time
# Each intermediate word must exist in the word list
# For example,

# Given:
# beginWord = "hit"
# endWord = "cog"
# wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
# As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
# return its length 5.

# bi-direct BFS
